# Mousetrap

(THIS PROJECT IS NOT YET FINISHED)

Mousetrap is a tiling window manager written in Rust. The name "Mousetrap" implies its one of the primary goals, which is, enable users to handle their application windows without the need for a mouse. In contrast to several other tiling window managers, Mousetrap entirely ignores mouse usage. The second primary goal is to have a small learning curve.
